# Lab Report 3
## ssh configure
Configure ~/.ssh/config to ssh to server easily

So that we do not need to type the whole address while connecting, we can simply use the alias we set
![](/report3-image/ssh_connect.png)
scp also no longer require the whole address

## GitHub access from ieng6
Public key was generated by `ssh-keygen` command and stored in `~/.ssh/rsa_id.pub` 
![](/report3-image/ssh-key.png)

Also setup in my GitHub account

Private key is stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
![](/report3-image/private_key.png)

Now we can commit change through ieng6

## Copy with `scp -r`
We can copy a whole directory to ieng6 with `scp -r` command

![](/report3-image/scp-r.png)

Now we can run the test on ieng6

![](/report3-image/run.png)

Or we can combine the whole process in one line of command
